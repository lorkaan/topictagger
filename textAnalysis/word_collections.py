Represents as Document object.

This is kinda obsolete, since a document is just a collection
of words, the source can be linked to the collection vai tuple.

Unless, a Document represents an interface for some collection
with Weighted Words being the data held by nodes

Additionally, can be used to filter out common words that have no meaning, while retaining
