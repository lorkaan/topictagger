# Topic Tagger

This project aims to use Natural Language Processing to extract topic words out of a set of text.

Currently, this is just a prototype and is useful for just performing experiments. 
Therefore, there are no installation or usage instruction at this time. 

# Future

I am currently working on this project as a joint venture with the [PySpider](https://github.com/lorkaan/pyspider) Prototype to create the [HTML Spider](https://github.com/lorkaan/htmlspider)
Project.
